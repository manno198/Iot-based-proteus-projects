# 🔧 Arduino + Proteus Simulation Projects

This repository contains simulation-ready projects combining **Arduino** code with **Proteus** circuit designs. Each project demonstrates real-world use cases with virtual hardware.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🔐 [RFID-Based Security/Lock System]
Simulates an RFID-controlled door lock. Valid tags display user names and activate a green LED; invalid tags trigger a buzzer and red LED.

### 2. 🔥 [LPG Gas Leakage Detection System]
Detects LPG gas leaks using the MQ-4 sensor. Triggers alerts via buzzer, LEDs, and LCD messages.

### 3. 🌦️ [IoT-Based Weather Station]
Monitors temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture, and rainfall using multiple sensors and displays real-time data on an LCD.
